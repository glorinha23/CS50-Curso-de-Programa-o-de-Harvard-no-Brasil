# Lab6: Word Cup in Python!

In this program we use a csv to identify the FIFA ranking of the men's or women's teams.
Then we do game simulations and calculate the probability of the results based on the ranking of the selections.
We will eliminate the selections at each stage of the tournament until we find the champion!
