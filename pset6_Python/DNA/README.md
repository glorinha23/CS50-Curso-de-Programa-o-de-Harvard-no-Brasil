# DNA, Python

The program aims to identify a person through their DNA.
To do so, it compares two files, the first containing a "database" of people with their respective codes and the second, a file with a DNA sequence. 
The program identifies the largest STR sequence and then compares it with the database to validate if it finds a relationship and, consequently, the person that matches the DNA.
