# Lab7: SONGS

This lab provides a database "songs.db", an SQLite database that stores Spotify data about songs and their artists.

We will run the following SQL queries:

* 1.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in the database.
* 2.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in ascending order of rhythm.
* 3.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of the 5 longest songs, in descending order of length.
* 4.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of any songs that have danceability, energy, and valence greater than 0.75.
* 5.sql, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of all songs.
* 6.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of Post Malone's songs.
* 7.sql, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of Drake's songs.
* 8.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of songs that feature “feat.” (participation) of other artists. Songs that feature other artists will include “feat.” in the name of the song.
